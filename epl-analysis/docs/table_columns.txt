Here are three concerns from West Ham:

i) Do the most expensive players win the league for the club? If so, why?  If not, why not?  Find out the stats on top most expensive players in relation to the team's standing.  Eg. Team Name, Player Fee, League Position

ii) Is there a superior playing style or approach that we should adopt?
Eg. possession %, number shots, % into opponent's half, etc

iii) Which areas are our players lacking in, compared to the players in the top teams?
Eg, distance covered, number of successful passes, rating, etc
