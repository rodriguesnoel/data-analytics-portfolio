# How Data Science Has Changed the Music Industry


## When I was 17 years old, I wanted to be a rock star. So I played at all my friends' and relatives' weddings, dodgy bars and any other stage I can perform on, with the hope that I would one day be rich and famous.

Fast-forward to today, and as you can tell... I didn't make it and am instead giving you a presentation on Data Analytics via Zoom.

When Ashley Frangipane, better known by her stage name, Halsey, was 17, she dropped out of college, got kicked out by her parents and attempted suicide.

During then, she started writing music and posted them onto YouTube, Tumblr (which is a blogging site) and Kik (which is a messaging app similar to WhatsApp).

In 2014, Halsey met a music producer at a party and together, they collaborated on a song called "Ghost" and it became pretty popular on YouTube and SoundCloud.

Because of that, Hasley got signed by Astralwerks which is owned by Universal Music Group, the world's second biggest record company.

## MUSIC & DATA SCIENCE

Now in the old days, you would have to play lots of gigs in bars and concerts to build up your fan base.

Before The Beatles became the biggest band in the world, they had played over a thousand gigs for six years before getting their big break. Halsey, on the other hand, had a much easier route. Her record company, Astralwerks, heavily uses data analytics to promote her. Here's how:

## CASE STUDY #01

When one of Halsey's songs, New Americana, was doing well on Apple Music, but not that well on Spotify and the Billboard charts, the bosses at Astralwerks started promoting Hasley to radio stations around the country, touting her as a beautiful, bisexual and outspoken artist.

By manipulating the data and seeing patterns and movements on how Halsey's song is doing, the record company surgically pinpointed where, how, and whom to promote.

As a result, the song hit Top 30 in the Billboard charts.

## CASE STUDY #02

Similarly, when American songwriter, Luh Kel, discovered that his song "Leave Me Alone" was doing well in the Philippines, his record company used data analytics to find out why. They found two Filipino YouTubers making it popular on their channel. So Luh Kel and his team quickly promoted the song in the country and the song went number 1 on Spotify Philippines.

## ALL ABOUT THE DATA

Most people now listen to music via Spotify, Apple Music or YouTube.

In the last four years, revenue from music streaming has more than doubled from $1.7 billion to $4.3 billion (see chart), with paid subscription being the biggest source of revenue.

Artist managers and record companies say that data analytics are essential to their business. More and more data experts are hired to keep tabs on streaming figures and markets.

Data Analytics tools such as Spotify's Luigi, Chartmetrics and Pandora's Music Genome Project are used prevalently to carve an edge. In short, data is like the "currency" for the music industry. 

## BENEFITS

Because of big data, Spotify can now predict the winners of the Grammy Awards simply by breaking down people's music listening habits. Their predictions have about a 30% accuracy, but I believe it will be better in the near future.

With data analytics, musicians can now know where they should be playing; which social media to promote on; and learn what kind of music is trending at different regions and countries.

## PITFALLS
At the same time, it is advisable to input music in the data AFTER it is made. If not, all the songs will sound pretty much the same, based on what is trending, and be carbon-copies of each other.

In fact, this is already happening to a certain extent as many songs on the radio sound similar today.

## OUTRO

So to recap... Data Analytics can help musicians make smart decisions to increase their chances of success. No longer, do talented artists need to rely on luck. But for listeners and audience, the proverbial question is:

Do you like data-tailored music or do you like finding an artist the old fashion way?
