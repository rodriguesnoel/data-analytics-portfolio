# Data Analytics Portfolio

## `HOLA`
Hello world, I'm Noel. I'm a data-driven storyteller and these are some of my work.

## `OVERVIEW`
This repository of data analytics projects demonstrates my skills in:
- Data Analysis and Machine Learning using Python
- SQL Database Queries and Analysis
- Excel Advanced Analytics and Visualization
- Comprehensive Data Reports

## `PROJECTS`

### Crop Yield Optimisation - Machine Learning Pipeline
This ML project predicts a regression issue as well as a classification problem.
- To predict and optimise the temperature conditions of a farm.
- To categorise the type and stage of various plants based on various variables.
- EDA done in Jupyter Notebook using libraries such as Pandas, Numpy, Matplotlib, and Seaborn
- Testing and End-to-end Machine Learning pipeline
- Key findings and insights
- Impact/results achieved

### Finding the Next Big Hit - Python Data Analysis
Predicting the next big hit on the song charts using 100 years of historical data from Spotify.
- The dataset gathered from Spotify Research contained variables such as artists name, song duration, energy, danceablity.
- Libraries used were Pandas, Numpy, Matplotlib, Scikit, and Seaborn
- The data was trained on various regression models such as Linear Regressoin, Lasso, and KNN.
- The model was then tested on KNN for final evaluation.
- The final prediction was systematically higher than the real value, so the model needed further tuning.

### Will I Get A Heart Attack - Python Data Analysis
A simple binary prediction if a patient is at risk of a heart attack.
- The dataset gathered from Kaggle contained variables such age, sex, blood pressure, cholesterol level, etc.
- Libraries used were Pandas, Numpy, Matplotlib, Scikit, and Seaborn
- The data was trained on Logistics Regression, Random Forest, and Decision Tree
- The model was then tested and predicted on Logistics Regression.
- The final prediction was that I will not get a heart attack.

### Who Will Win the English Premier League - Excel & SQL Analysis
Will data science help EPL clubs win the league?
- Every professional sport club is using data science to optimise their chances in winning.
- Gathered data from Google Dataset Search and Kaggle.
- Use SQL for data cleaning, and exported to Excel for data visualisation and evaluation.
- Sport clubs use advanced clustering methods for quick and deep analysis for their player recruitment.

### How Data Science Changed the Music Industry - Comprehensive Data Report
Big data are helping record labels and musicians tweak their offerings for higher airplay.
- A non-technical but evidence-based story on the power of data science.
- Using case studies as an analytical approach.
- Data analytics are easily available for musicians to exploit but would that gentrified music?
- Good primer for data analytics students.
